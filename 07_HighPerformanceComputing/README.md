# Final Project

This directory contains the code for my final project as described in the University of Washington's High Performance Scientific Computing course [http://faculty.washington.edu/rjl/classes/am583s2013/notes/project.html#project]

### Part 1
Estimate the integral of f(x) from a to b using the **_Trapezoid Rule_** with n points.
```
$ make test3
```

### Part 2
Estimate the  **_Monte Carlo approximation_** to the integral of g(x) from a to b.
```
$ make plot
```

### Part 3
**_Random walk approximate solution_** to Laplace's equation u<sub>xx</sub> + u<sub>yy</sub> = 0.
```
$ make plot
```

### Part 4
**_Parallel version (MPI)_** of Part 3 above
```
$ make plot
```
